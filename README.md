#  Coffee Shop Revenue Analysis

Exploring operational and marketing factors that influence daily revenue in coffee shops using a Kaggle dataset.

---

## ** Project Summary**

This project analyzes a dataset of 2,000 daily entries from various coffee shops. We explored how factors such as foot traffic, customer count, order value, operating hours, employee count, and marketing spend affect daily revenue. The goal was to uncover which variables most strongly influence business performance.

---

## ** Part 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- Cleaned and explored the dataset using **Python** in Jupyter Notebook  
- Verified there were **no nulls or duplicate values**  
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` to summarize structure and statistics  
- Final dataset included **7 key features** and a **target variable**: `Daily Revenue ($)`

---

## ** Part 2: Analysis & Visualizations**

We investigated the relationships between revenue and operational features using scatter plots, line graphs, and interactive dashboards in **Tableau**.

Key analyses included:
- **Foot Traffic vs. Customer Count**  
- **Operating Hours vs. Daily Revenue**  
- **Employee Count vs. Customer Count**  
- **Marketing Spend vs. Daily Revenue**  
- **Customer Count & Average Order Value vs. Daily Revenue**

---

## ** Key Findings**

- **Customer count** and **average order value** are the **strongest predictors** of revenue  
- **Foot traffic** and **marketing spend** show **weak positive correlations**  
- **Operating hours** and **employee count** have **minimal impact** on revenue  
- The **best-performing days** tend to have both **high customer count** and **high average order value**

---

## ** Business Implications**

- Focus on strategies to **increase customer traffic** and **boost order value**  
- Avoid over-investing in areas like longer hours or extra staffing without supporting data  
- Use dashboards to identify what drives top performance on high-revenue days

---

## ** Ethical Considerations**

- All data used was **anonymized** and **free of personal identifiers**  
- Context was included to **avoid misinterpretation or biased conclusions**  
- Care was taken to **validate correlations** and **avoid overstating causality**

---

## ** Tools Used**

- **Python** – Data cleaning and exploration (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Tableau** – Visualizations and interactive dashboard  
- **Microsoft Word & PowerPoint** – Final report and presentation

## ** Collaboration**

This project was completed jointly by **Rusi Rothschild** and **Chashy Luria**.  
We collaborated on all aspects of the analysis, visualizations, and reporting via Zoom.
