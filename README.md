# Coffee Shop Revenue Analysis
Overview
This project explores key drivers of daily revenue for coffee shops using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 2,000 rows with 7 features related to daily operations, including customer count, average order value, operating hours, marketing spend, foot traffic, and more.

Tools Used
Python (for data cleaning and exploration)

Tableau (for interactive visualizations and dashboard)

Jupyter Notebook

Microsoft Word & PowerPoint (for presentation and report formatting)

Key Questions Explored
Does higher foot traffic correlate with more customers?

Do longer operating hours lead to more revenue?

Does marketing spend impact customer count or revenue?

Which has a greater effect on revenue: number of customers or average order value?

Key Findings
Customer count and average order value are the strongest predictors of revenue.

Foot traffic and marketing spend show weak positive correlations with revenue.

Operating hours and employee count have minimal direct impact on revenue.

Interactive Tableau dashboard allows for deeper exploration of these relationships.

Ethical Considerations
Emphasis was placed on data privacy and avoiding misrepresentation.

All data used was anonymized, and conclusions were contextualized to avoid bias.
